UNIVERSITY MOTTO:
</h2>
<h3>
Primus Inter Pares
</h3>

The Crest of Gombe State University is embedded in a shield-shaped structure with an electron, depicting science, a torch indicating light and a book representing knowledge hidden and awaiting divulgence.

The shield depicts Gombe State as entirely located within a dark green background, which portrays the agrarian nature of the people while the light blue colour running across the width of the shield gives a picture of the river that flows across the state.

The red line brings to mind the heroes past. Bordering the entire crest is a black colour which reveals the abundance of solid minerals in and around the state while at the bottom end of the crest is the motto, Primus Inter Pares, which in its entirety, implies that the University is the FIRST AMONGST EQUALSin its endless quest for knowledge, excellence and relevance.

This fourth edition of handbook has been thoroughly reviewed to address hitherto grey areas in the last editions. This will definitely give a good guide for prospective students on the available programmes for admission and registration requirements. While for matriculated students it gives comprehensive guide on what is expected of them during their stay in the university. The language is so explicit, it is hoped that students will read and understand the contents and seek clarification where they have any doubts. The student’s affairs directorate is always available to attend to students matters.

It is also expected that both academic and non-academic staff would fine time to read it and assist in guiding students when the need arises. Parents and Guardians should fine time to familiarize with the contents of this booklet so as to help in counselling and guiding their respective wards. The administration has made necessary provisions by creating a conducive teaching, learning environment for students and will continue to improve and provide more facilities.


However, in order to entrench discipline in the system the rules /regulations and penalties as contained in this booklet will be strictly adhered to. Students are therefore, advised to guide against deliberate flouting of regulations.

I wish you a successful stay in Gombe State University. Thank you.

BRIEF HISTORY OF GOMBE STATE UNIVERSITY

On his assumption of office on May 29th 2003, the Governor of Gombe State, Alhaji Muhammad Danjuma Goje (Sarkin Yakin Gombe) made clear his determination to provide sound qualitative education in the State. This was a particularly significant declaration which expressed the Government's readiness to provide a good tertiary institution for thousands of Senior Secondary School Certificate holders at a time of stiffer competition for admission into institutions of higher learning that have Gombe State as one of their catchments states. To this end, a Ministry of Higher Education was created to, among other things, advice the government on modalities for establishing a state-owned tertiary institution(s).

The Ministry in turn, set-up an Advisory committee whose report was deliberated upon by the State's Executive Council which subsequently resolved to establish a State-owned University to be named and addressed as Gombe State University (GSU).

The State Executive Council also agreed that the university should be located on a single campus, sited in the State Capital, Gombe. It also resolved that the Gombe State University should be a conventional University so that it accommodates the human-power needs of both the public and the private sectors in the state and beyond.

As a follow up to these decisions, the State Executive Council approved the constitution of a 24-member Technical and Planning Committee and based on their report to the Council, an implementation Committee was put in place for the smooth take-off of the University.

Gombe State University formally took-off after the passage of the bill for its establishment by the State House of Assembly on April 14th, 2004, the signing of the bill into Law by the Governor and Visitor to the University, Alhaji Muhammad Danjuma Goje, on May 3rd, 2004 and the Federal Government's licensing of the University on May 7th, 2004. Thereafter, the Implementation Committee paid full attention to the physical development of the University as well as the appointment of its pioneer Vice-Chancellor and other Principal/Management Staff for the University. As soon as a suitable site was found in Gombe, this committee continued its work until the University's 11 member Governing Council was constituted and subsequently inaugurated on February 15lh, 2005.

Schools, Colleges and Government Parastatals in the identified site in the Tudun Wada Quarters of Gombe metropolis, were relocated to allow for its speedy transformation and development. Undergraduate teaching started in the three foundation Faculties of Education, Science, Arts and Social Sciences in the 2005/2006 Academic Session. The School of Basic and Remedial Studies (SBRS) of the University also started its own academic activities in the 2004/2005 academic session.

The University has grown over the years to become a Center of learning with five Faculties (Faculty of Science, Arts and Social Sciences, Education, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Law) and College of Medical Sciences with three faculties (Basic Medical Sciences, Basic Clinical Sciences and Clinical sciences) and Directorate of Human Resource. There are over hundred undergraduate and postgraduate programmes offered in the university.
